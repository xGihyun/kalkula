# Kalkula   

A **scientific calculator** desktop application that saves your written formulas on your system.

> This app currently works on **Linux only**, as there are parts on the source code that are still hard coded.
> A lot of bugs are still present.

## What is Kalkula?

Inspired by [Desmos' Scientific Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/scientific), Kalkula is an application that offers more capabilities such as **workspaces** and **persisted formulas**.

### Workspaces

When solving multiple Math problems, opening a new instance of a calculator can get messy, and resetting all of your written formulas may not be ideal.

Kalkula solves this issues with **workspaces**, which allows you to create separate instances of a scientific calculator all within a single instance of Kalkula, while also automatically saving your written formulas on each workspace locally through a [libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) file created on your system.
